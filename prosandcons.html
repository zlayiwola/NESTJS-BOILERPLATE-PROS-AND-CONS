            </section>

            <section id="nestjs">
                <h3>1. NestJS Boilerplate</h3>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

            </section>

            <section id="express">
                <h3>2. Express.js Boilerplate</h3>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simplicity: It is a very simple application, allowing developers to work easily and get started without any complex setup.</li>
                    <li>Flexibility: Due to its simplicity and lack of opinionated structure, it allows developers to create applications with their unique architecture. It is easy to extend and customize.</li>
                </ul>
